"""Clause 1, read through the per-language node vocabulary instead of Python's own parser.

L1.21 was written against Python's `ast` module, so a JavaScript file could be graded on
two clauses out of nineteen and nothing structural could be seen at all. The rest of this
analyzer went multi-language long ago: `lang_spec` carries per-language node types for nine
languages and the other twenty indicators read them.

There is one implementation, not two. A second Python-only copy of each rule would be a
value with two owners and nothing checking they agree, which is the defect this package
spent a night removing from four other places.

THE RISK IS NOT THE PORTING. It is silently changing what a clause MEANS while porting it,
so the rule runs on JavaScript and quietly measures something else. Every case below
therefore asserts both directions on the same source: the clause fires on the violation and
goes quiet when the violation alone is removed. A fixture that only fires proves the clause
runs, not that it is reading the thing it names.
